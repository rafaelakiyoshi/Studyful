# What is _Studyful_?

Studyful is a crowd-based platform to help students in their studies for the [ENEM](https://enem.inep.gov.br/).

Their answers are saved and their progress along the subjects are measured, giving them a better vision of their progress.



## Features

Here are the features of _Studyful_

### Crowd-Centered
We let the students, or anyone else, create new questions and expand the community. The questions feed a network of knowledge and creates a Database that any student can View, Answer, Validate and Classify the question as easy or Hard.

### A Guide for the Student
As the students answers the questions in the plataform, we provide them the feedback to indicate what is the next subject they should study!


### Tracking
_Studyful_ track the students performance to help him visualize where their need to study now. We calculate where the student is good enough in a subject and suggest to move on to the next.
